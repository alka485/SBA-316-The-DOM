### Overview 
## SBA 316
This is the simple web page of a restaurent.

## Reflection

## What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

I think I must have first checked the requirements which was missing when i first created the site

## Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

working on document fragment was tough because I am not used to document fragment

## What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

I think I will work more on images and it's info I am unable to get the alignment which I want
